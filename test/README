# The ** *ROBÓTICO* ** Arduino robot

This project starts with my little child idea to create his own robot, called Robótico, by herself.

We used some parts I brought some time late:

- Four motors chassis with wells;
- Battery 6V/4.5Ah Pb Battery;
- Arduino UNO;
- ProtoShield;
- HC05 Bluetooth Module;
- L298N for DC Motor control;
- Some software that work with android tablet.

The first idea was to make a line follower, but she want to "play" with them, so we use the Bluetooth to control with her tablet. The second and third steps will to use a joystick (I didn't chose if we'll use another Arduino or some Bluetooth controller) and then implement the line follower.

Later then, we'll change the Arduino to a RapberryPI3 to control with camera and vision computing (one day.. ;-) )
